**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements.<br>**
The client, The Gaming Room, wanted to expand their game application, Draw It or Lose It, beyond Android to support multiple platforms. They required a web-based, secure system that could scale to handle many players and interact across various devices. The software needed to include robust user authentication, role-based access, and a responsive client interface.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?<br>**
I provided clear, structured documentation that explained each design choice. I clearly outlined the role of each component in the system—from authentication to RESTful communication—making it easier for both developers and non-technical stakeholders to understand the design rationale.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?<br>**
Working through the design document helped me break down the project into manageable components. It clarified how the client’s requirements translated into specific technical tasks, ensuring that security, scalability, and multi-platform compatibility were addressed from the beginning. This approach minimized confusion during coding and kept the development focused on user needs.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?<br>**
I would refine the section on future enhancements. I’d add more detailed plans for scaling and incorporating new features, such as integrating with additional gaming platforms (Xbox, PS4) and expanding the user management system. This would make the design more forward-looking and provide clearer guidance for future development.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?<br>**
I interpreted the user’s needs by analyzing their requirement to expand to multiple platforms while ensuring security and scalability. These needs were reflected in the choice of a RESTful API, role-based authentication, and a flexible, distributed architecture. Considering the user’s needs is vital because it ensures that the final product is not only technically sound but also provides a smooth, secure, and engaging experience for end users.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?<br>**
I began by breaking down the requirements and mapping them to technical components. I used a top-down approach to design the overall architecture and a bottom-up approach for specific components like authentication and REST endpoints. In the future, I’d continue using techniques such as modular design, iterative feedback, and user-centric design principles to ensure that the software is both robust and tailored to the client's needs.
